The physical layer must generate the electrical, optical, or wireless signals that represent
 the "1" and "0" on the media. The method of representing the bits is called the signaling method.
 The physical layer standards must define what type of signal represents a "1" and what type of
 signal represents a "0". This can be as simple as a change in the level of an electrical signal
 or optical pulse. For example, a long pulse might represent a 1, whereas a short pulse represents a 0.
This is similar to how Morse code is used for communication. Morse code is another signaling method
 that uses a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks to send text over telephone wires or between ships at sea.
