    <h1>Signaling </h1>

    <p>The physical layer must generate the electrical, optical, or wireless signals that
 represent the "1" and "0" on the media. The method of representing the bits is called the
 signaling method. The physical layer standards must define what type of signal represents 
a "1" and what type of signal represents a "0". This can be as simple as a change in the 
level of an electrical signal or optical pulse.
 For example, a long pulse might represent a 1, whereas a short pulse represents a 0.
